# Catch_The_Diamond_Game
The game "Catch The Diamond" uses the "Midpoint Line Drawing Algorithm". In the game, a diamond falls from the top of the window to the bottom, and 
a catcher is at the bottom to touch the diamond. The game progressively increases the speed of the diamond as it falls multiple times.
